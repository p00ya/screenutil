# Screenutil
ScreenUtil v1.0 - Copyright (C) Mowlem Enterprises Ltd 2006.

This is abandonware formerly found at mowlem-enterprises.co.uk.

Use it to change screen resolution on a mac programatically:
    
    scrutil s 2880 1800 16

Last argument is color depth.


## Usage

The _ScreenUtil_ (scrutil) help page can be invoked using the command "`scrutil h`". The resulting information is:

`scrutil [<option>[<type>]]`

	Options:

> `h		display this help text`

> `v		display version information`

> `n		show the number of displays`

> `i		show full information about the display(s)`

> `c		show the current display mode`

> `d		show all supported display modes`

> `r		show recommended display modes`

> `s <mode>	switch the main display to the given mode`

> `t <mode>	set the user's display preferences to the given mode`

> `q		exit the application`


	Mode:

> `In the set actions above the <mode> is specified as <w> <h> <d> [<r>] where:`
> 
> `<w> is the width in pixels`
> 
> `<h> is the height in pixels`
> 
> `<d> is the bit depth in bits per pixel`
> 
> `[r] is optional and is the refresh rate in Hertz`

	Types:

> `The type is relevant only for the i, c, d and r commands. It defines what displays the command applies to:`
> 
> `m	report on the main (primary) display only`
> 
> `a	report on active displays only`
> 
> `o	report on all online displays (online means that a display is attached to the graphics port)`

	Server Mode:

> `If no arguments are given then scrutil runs as a server and accepts commands entered on the console.`
> 
> `It runs in a loop until either the q(uit) command or a blank line is entered.`

## Limitations

The utility scrutil only works on the built-in or main monitor (display). If you are looking to manipulate the configuration of an external display, you must look elsewhere.
